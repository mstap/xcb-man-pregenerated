.SH REQUEST ARGUMENTS
.IP \fIconn\fP 1i
The XCB connection to X11.
.IP \fIowner_events\fP 1i
If 1, the \fIgrab_window\fP will still get the pointer events. If 0, events are not
reported to the \fIgrab_window\fP.
.IP \fIgrab_window\fP 1i
Specifies the window on which the pointer should be grabbed.
.IP \fIevent_mask\fP 1i
Specifies which pointer events are reported to the client.

TODO: which values?
.IP \fIpointer_mode\fP 1i
One of the following values:
.RS 1i
.IP \fIXCB_GRAB_MODE_SYNC\fP 1i
The state of the keyboard appears to freeze: No further keyboard events are
generated by the server until the grabbing client issues a releasing
\fIAllowEvents\fP request or until the keyboard grab is released.
.IP \fIXCB_GRAB_MODE_ASYNC\fP 1i
Keyboard event processing continues normally.
.RE
.RS 1i

.RE
.IP \fIkeyboard_mode\fP 1i
One of the following values:
.RS 1i
.IP \fIXCB_GRAB_MODE_SYNC\fP 1i
The state of the keyboard appears to freeze: No further keyboard events are
generated by the server until the grabbing client issues a releasing
\fIAllowEvents\fP request or until the keyboard grab is released.
.IP \fIXCB_GRAB_MODE_ASYNC\fP 1i
Keyboard event processing continues normally.
.RE
.RS 1i

.RE
.IP \fIconfine_to\fP 1i
Specifies the window to confine the pointer in (the user will not be able to
move the pointer out of that window).

The special value \fIXCB_NONE\fP means don't confine the pointer.
.IP \fIcursor\fP 1i
Specifies the cursor that should be displayed or \fIXCB_NONE\fP to not change the
cursor.
.IP \fItime\fP 1i
The time argument allows you to avoid certain circumstances that come up if
applications take a long time to respond or if there are long network delays.
Consider a situation where you have two applications, both of which normally
grab the pointer when clicked on. If both applications specify the timestamp
from the event, the second application may wake up faster and successfully grab
the pointer before the first application. The first application then will get
an indication that the other application grabbed the pointer before its request
was processed.

The special value \fIXCB_CURRENT_TIME\fP will be replaced with the current server
time.
.SH DESCRIPTION
Actively grabs control of the pointer. Further pointer events are reported only to the grabbing client. Overrides any active pointer grab by this client.
.SH RETURN VALUE
TODO: not yet generated
.SH ERRORS
.IP \fIxcb_window_error_t\fP 1i
The specified \fIwindow\fP does not exist.
.IP \fIxcb_value_error_t\fP 1i
TODO: reasons?
