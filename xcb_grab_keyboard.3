.SH REQUEST ARGUMENTS
.IP \fIconn\fP 1i
The XCB connection to X11.
.IP \fIowner_events\fP 1i
If 1, the \fIgrab_window\fP will still get the pointer events. If 0, events are not
reported to the \fIgrab_window\fP.
.IP \fIgrab_window\fP 1i
Specifies the window on which the pointer should be grabbed.
.IP \fItime\fP 1i
Timestamp to avoid race conditions when running X over the network.

The special value \fIXCB_CURRENT_TIME\fP will be replaced with the current server
time.
.IP \fIpointer_mode\fP 1i
One of the following values:
.RS 1i
.IP \fIXCB_GRAB_MODE_SYNC\fP 1i
The state of the keyboard appears to freeze: No further keyboard events are
generated by the server until the grabbing client issues a releasing
\fIAllowEvents\fP request or until the keyboard grab is released.
.IP \fIXCB_GRAB_MODE_ASYNC\fP 1i
Keyboard event processing continues normally.

.IP \fIkeyboard_mode\fP 1i

generated by the server until the grabbing client issues a releasing
\fIAllowEvents\fP request or until the keyboard grab is released.

.SH DESCRIPTION
Actively grabs control of the keyboard and generates FocusIn and FocusOut
events. Further key events are reported only to the grabbing client.

Any active keyboard grab by this client is overridden. If the keyboard is
actively grabbed by some other client, \fIAlreadyGrabbed\fP is returned. If
\fIgrab_window\fP is not viewable, \fIGrabNotViewable\fP is returned. If the keyboard
is frozen by an active grab of another client, \fIGrabFrozen\fP is returned. If the
specified \fItime\fP is earlier than the last-keyboard-grab time or later than the
current X server time, \fIGrabInvalidTime\fP is returned. Otherwise, the
last-keyboard-grab time is set to the specified time.
.SH RETURN VALUE
TODO: not yet generated
.SH ERRORS
.IP \fIxcb_window_error_t\fP 1i
The specified \fIwindow\fP does not exist.
.IP \fIxcb_value_error_t\fP 1i
TODO: reasons?
